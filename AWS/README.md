## Regions
- AWS has several regions (physical location around the world where amazon clusters data centres) where you can create resources: each region has several availability zones (consists of one or more data centres at a location within an AWS region - each AZ has independent cooling, power and physical security
- If app is partitioned accross AZs, companies are better isolated/ protected from power outages, natural disasters (AZs within a region are separated within 100km from each other)
- Pick region (and AZ) thats geographically close to company/ customers:  lowest network latency and quickest response

## Data centres
- Each region has at least 2 data centres, means its highly available
    - If one data centre becomes unavailable there is a backup
