# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes.
- IaC config files contain your infrastructure specs, making it easier to edit and distribute configs => same environment every time.
- Codifying and documenting your configuration specs, IaC aids config management & helps avoiding undocumented, ad-hoc config changes.
- Codify everything as scripts using IaC tools
    - Ansible: Configuration management, only need to set up on master node
    - SonerCube
    - Terraform: Orchestration


## Ansible
 - Ansible is a tool that helps you automate tasks to achieve the desired state in a system.
 - Tasks can be defining a package that needs to be installed, web server/ database settings, full deployment orchestration.
