# Microserve
- Microservice
Consists of a collection of small, autonomous services, each service is self-contained.
- Advantages	
	- Microservices are deployed independently => easy to manage bug fixes and feature releases
	- Compared to monolithic application, code dependencies can become tangled adding a new feature requires editing code in many places, in a microservice you don't share code or data stores, minimising dependencies making it much easier to add new features.
	- You can use different technologies that fit your microservice
	- If a microservice becomes unavailable this does not distrupt the entire app
	- Microservices can be scaled independently from each other
- Disadvantages
	- There are lots of moving parts compared to monolithic applications, the system is more complex
	- Teams may use many different languages/frameworks meaning the app as a whole is difficult to maintain
