# DevOps Intro
DevOps = Dev (development) + Ops (operations)

## Life before DevOps
- Separate departments worked on different sides of a project
- Developers planned, designed and built the system before passing it over to the operations team for testing and implementation

### The problem
- Often a delay between the development and full implementation because of this separation between dev and ops
    - If there was something that needed to be reconfigured/ bug found/ not meeting user requirements, operation team would have to pass it back to development with the feedback and wait for updates
- Creates a blame culture  
## Why DevOps
- Devops expects people to make mistakes and is designed to allow these mistakes to be identified early on in the cycle and corrected before they make it any further => a blameless culture
- Software development lifecycle is shorter and more simple
- Developers and operations collaberate to deploy code to production faster in an automated/repeatable way
- Shorter + more simple #= faster = reduced costs

## Key pillars of DevOps
1. Customer-Centric action - focus on the customer needs
    - Use 'user stories' to plan your sprints, make sure you meet these requirements
2. End-To-End Responsibility - provide performance support from the beginning to the end of the life cycle
3. Continuous Improvement
4. Automate everything - everything as code: testing, application environment, version control
5. Work as one team
6. Monitor and test everything

## Stages in DevOps Lifecycle
- Continuous Development
- Continuous Testing
- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Deployment
- Continuous Monitoring

## Monolith Architecture
Traditional unified model for the design of a software program, software is composed all in one piece.
